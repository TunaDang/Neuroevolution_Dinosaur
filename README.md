# Neuroevolution_Dinosaur
###Chrome's famous Dinosaur game grows smarter on its own (with a little help from neural network Topologies).

**Credits to**: Kenneth O. Stanley and Risto Miikkulainen at the Department of Computer Sciences, The University of Texas at Austin for their seminal paper "Efficient Evolution of Neural Network Topologies" and NEAT-Python library. Tech with Tim and harsitbaral for inspiration. Last but not least, the numerous open-source contributors to the pygame library without which this project would have taken countless more painstaking (and fun) hours than it already has.
